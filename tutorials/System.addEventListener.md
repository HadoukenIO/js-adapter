### Example

```js
// The below functions are provided to add an event listener.
fin.System.addListener('monitor-info-changed', (evnt) => {
    console.log("The monitor information has changed to: ", evnt);
});

fin.System.on('monitor-info-changed', (evnt) => {
    console.log("The monitor information has changed to: ", evnt);
});

fin.System.once('monitor-info-changed', (evnt) => {
    console.log("The monitor information has changed to: ", evnt);
});

fin.System.prependListener('monitor-info-changed', (evnt) => {
